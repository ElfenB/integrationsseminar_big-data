# Integrationsseminar big data

This project is for university. It covers a 'big data' topic of my choice.

Data preparation is mainly done with Excel and Python. There are 4 main data sources, covering mainly the years 2016-2020:

- Fuel prices
- Mortality in Germany
- Traffic accidents in Germany
- Temperature from 20 different places in Germany

The focus is on the correlation and the r- and p-values, to prove hypotheses for correlation.

test.py shows the in Milestone requested import and a first plot.
h1.py, h2.py, h3.py and h4.py calculate the values needed for each hypotheses.
