# Integrationsseminar big data

This project is for university. It covers a 'big data' topic of my choice.

Data preparation is mainly done with Excel and Python. There are 4 main data sources, covering mainly the years 2016-2020:

- Fuel prices
- Mortality in Germany
- Traffic accidents in Germany
- Temperature from 20 different places in Germany

The focus is on the correlation and the r- and p-values, to prove hypotheses for correlation.

h1, h2, h3 and h4 calculate the values needed for each hypotheses.
